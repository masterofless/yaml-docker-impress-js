Effective Meeting Facilitation
==============================

My Goals for This Presentation
------------------------------

To Inform, Perhaps Even to Educate:

- Why effective meeting facilitation is important
- How we can get better at facilitating effective meetings

To Motivate:

- So you might enhance your habits for your own meetings
- That you might hold others accountable for doing so

To Demonstrate, to *entertain*, and to Learn


I Know You Already Know
-----------------------

I know you have been facilitating meetings for years;  I know you already know how.

But, I bet you'd admit that you *could* do it better more often than not.

And, hopefully there will be a nugget or two in here that resonates for you.


Why Effective Meeting Facilitation Is Important
-----------------------------------------------

Poorly-managed meetings *suck* for everyone involved

- Including non-present stakeholders, after all, our time is their money
- They waste time, accomplishing little or no actual business value
- They drain people's energy and create frustration
- They *deter* real participation in the desired outcomes, for present and future meetings

Well-managed meetings are effective, they feel good, and they are a lot more fun

- They are far more likely to achieve immediate, tangible, positive results
- They are more efficient, using less time and money for similar or better results
- Create positive energy for the participants as they feel impactful, respected and valued
- They reinforce a sense of contributing to something larger than oneself


How to Have Effective Meetings
------------------------------

0. Set Goals
1. Plan the Meeting
2. Inform
3. Prepare
4. Structure and Control
5. Summarize and Record


Plan: Get Clear on the Goal(s): Why
-----------------------------------

A meeting with no goal is just a discussion.  At a formal meeting, discussion is a means, not an end in itself.

Think through what it is really needs to be accomplished and what *you* are really trying to accomplish

Perhaps you mean "To Inform", "To Understand", or "To Align", "To Decide", "To Learn" rather than "To Discuss".  The difference is important.

Maybe you don't even need to have a meeting.  Will a simple email suffice?  Perhaps just an impromptu visit or two?

Even small meetings, especially standing/regular ones, are fairly heavy-weight; think about whether you can achieve the goal in a better/faster/cheaper way.

Well-crafted goals are:

- Clear
- Concize
- Achievable
- Complete
- ???


Plan: Get Clear on the Agenda: What
-----------------------------------

An agenda is not a substitute for a goal(s).

An agenda is the content the team needs to cover in order to reach the goal(s)

Use a logical sequence for the goal(s), attendees, time frame

Agenda topics *might need to be time-boxed* to ensure the overall goal(s) is met

Allocate time based on importance, not urgency

Ensure there is enough time to accomplish the goals with the attendees.  If not, you might need to reschedule follow-up.


Plan: Have Just the Right People
--------------------------------

Invite all the people, and *only* those people, actually required to meet the goal

It is important to limit the number of people to the essentials.  We all have a need to be understood, so the time necessary to conduct any amount of business effectively goes up with every additional person.

If any of the required people cannot make it, seriously consider postponing it.  But, perhaps they are NOT so required...

Plan: Do Not Have A Meeting If You Should Not or Do Not Need One
----------------------------------------------------------------

Some meetings, especially with a goal of "to inform" might be better as a simple email, or a few informal discussions

Any time the information flow is essentially one direction, that is a good candidate for an email (unless there are likely to be emotional reactions to the information)


Inform Effectively: Communicate Concisely, Thoroughly
-----------------------------------------------------

Make sure all the attendees, plus any other critical stakeholders, know the goals and the agenda

Anticipate needs and issues and provide or mitigate

Identify clearly what prerequisites attendees should accomplish and/or what they need to bring with them


So What If I Don't Do Those Things?
-----------------------------------

If I can end up with the same meeting outcomes, why do I need to do all that planning?

Because Trust.

Trust is the magic fabric of the Human Universe.  With it, great things are possible, and without it everything is painful and difficult.

Trust is only developed through trustworthy behavior

Trustworthy behavior requires, primarily, two (2) critical actions
    - Declaring what you intend to do (you can't leave this step out and build trust)
    - Doing what you said you intended to do (which establishes competency and confidence)

Establishing and communicating the goals for a meeting is an important element of trustworthy behavior for those who call meetings


Structure and Control: Facilitate Effectively in the Moment
-----------------------------------------------------------

Get there early enough to get set up and ensure everything you need is there and working

Start on time, or just a *little* fashionably late, once a quorum is present

Keep time and stick the agenda

Normally, whoever called a meeting facilitates it, but often that is not true

Facilitators participate as well more often than not, but if the meeting is large enough, that may be difficult.  A different facilitator may be utilized by the meeting sponsor so she can more fully participate without distraction or domination

What do you do when no quorum arrives on time?


Structure and Control: Establish and Stick to Ground Rules
----------------------------------------------------------

Identify the importance of and encourage:

- Open-ness
- Safety
- Respect
- Participation
- Focus

As necessary, establish ground rules for the meeting e.g.:

- Use of screens
- Letting people finish
- Respect time-boxing
- Parking lot tangents


Structure and Control: Somebody Probably Has to Scribe
------------------------------------------------------

Most meetings, even many short stand-ups, need someone to write down any decisions, action items, etc.

The facilitator should be responsible for doing it, or assigning somebody else to do it


Structure and Control: Make Sure Everyone Knows Each Other
----------------------------------------------------------

Trust is the critical glue of the universe, and you cannot really trust someone you do not know

For normal meetings, between 3 and 20 people, everyone should know each other's first name and enough about their role to understand why they are at the meeting

The more divergent the opinions, background, and knowledge of the topic areas of the participants, the more important this is

Larger "meetings" are more likely "Presentations" which is a different topic


Structure and Control: Choose a Structure
-----------------------------------------

Standing meetings often already have well-defined goals, topics areas AND structure

When decisions need to be made, use a sequence resembling:

    1. Evidence
    2. Interpretation
    3. Action

When problem-solving, consider frameworks such as "5 Whys"


Structure and Control: Important Concentrations
-----------------------------------------------

1. Unite
    - Let off the steam
    - Don't take sides
    - Bring in the non-combatants
    - Stick to facts
1. Focus
    - Stay alert and watch out for irrelevant contributions
    - Keep a hand on the wheel
    - Test comprehension
    - Paraphrase and check back
1. Mobilize
    - Protect the weak and keep the strong under control
    - Check around the group and collect all contributions
    - Record all suggestions to avoid losing good points
    - Build up ideas, don't know them down


Structure and Control: Consider the Participants' Tendencies
------------------------------------------------------------

While more important in a presentation, it might be helpful even in a meeting to consider the audience's [social styles](http://changingminds.org/explanations/preferences/social_styles.htm):

- Driver/Dominant
- Social
- Expressive/Amiable
- Analytical

Especially when educating, consider the audience's [learning styles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles):

- Visual/spatial
- Aural/auditory
- Verbal/linguistic
- Physical/kinesthetic
- Logical/Mathematical
- Social/interpersonal
- Solitary/intra-personal

Structure and Control: Manage Group and Individual Dynamics
-----------------------------------------------------------

Ensure participants have a chance to, are encouraged to, get their thoughts heard by the whole group

Ensure individuals do not over-dominate the discussion time


Structure and Control: Be Focused First, Flexible Second
--------------------------------------------------------

Focus on achieving the goal(s), but:

Sometimes the attendees realize there is a better goal, or that the goal cannot yet be achieved without other prerequisites being met

Be open to the group figuring out it needs to change course

Avoid retracing old ground


Structure and Control: Be Creative
----------------------------------

Try and find ways to create fun and engagement

Consider using alternatives to a standard discussion format such as:

- Role playing
- Brainstorming
- Mind mapping
- Scenario building
- Round robin
- Root cause analysis techniques


Structure and Control: Use a "Parking Lot" for Tangents
-----------------------------------------------------

Often people identify topics/issues they want to discuss but that are outside the scope established by the goals of the meeting.

A visible Parking Lot can be used to record topics that were identified but will not be covered in the meeting.  Whiteboards or a paper easel are good for these items.

Any Parking Lot items should be dispositioned at the end of, or after, the meeting for follow-up.


Summarize and Record: Articulate the Outcomes
---------------------------------------------

Before time runs out on a meeting, articulate the results you understood

- Outcomes
- Decisions
- Action Items with assignments
    - Include plans, or not, to handle Parking Lot items

If there is any doubt about whether the goals were met, that should also be established

Summarize and Record: Follow-Up in Writing
------------------------------------------

Any significant outcomes, as well as useful notes, of the meeting should be emailed to all participants and any stakeholders in  those outcomes as soon as possible after the meeting


Standing Meetings Are Easier, But No Different
----------------------------------------------

Frequently the goal(s) and agenda of standing meetings are already clearly defined and understood by the participants.  If so, there is no need to reiterate those every time.


Some Important Psychological Truths to Keep In Mind
---------------------------------------------------

Everyone has a need to feel understood

Few people like unpleasant surprises, especially in group situations

Some people are uncomfortable speaking in group situations

Some participants may feel confused, inadequate, insecure, superior, etc.

Everyone brings preconceptions about the goals, topics, and participants that unconsciously inhibit open-ness to other points of view

Everyone brings their own predisposition to be positive or negative about *change*, which is what meetings are often about

Restating
----------

1. Plan, starting with clear, achievable goals
2. Inform the attendees and stakeholders
3. Prepare
4. Structure and Control, everybody likes fun
5. Summarize and Record, make sure it sticks


How Could This Presentation Be Better
-------------------------------------

- Things to amplify
- Things to reduce, avoid, eliminate
