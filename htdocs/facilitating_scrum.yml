        subheader: Why Effective Meeting Facilitation Is Important
        text: >
            Many of you might not facilitate meetings often, others may already know all of this stuff and do it very well.  Even if so, I bet you'd admit that you *could* do it better more often than not.  I know I do.
            Hopefully there will be a nugget or two in here that resonates for you.
            Also, think of this as a superset of things to do for all meetings; no meeting uses all techniques.
    -
        header: Poorly-managed meetings *suck* for everyone involved
        bullets:
            - Including non-present stakeholders, after all, our time is their money
            - They waste time, accomplishing little or no actual business value
            - They drain people's energy and create frustration
            - They *deter* real participation in the desired outcomes, for present and future meetings
    -
        header: Well-managed meetings are effective, they feel good, and they are a lot more fun
        bullets:
            - They are far more likely to achieve immediate, tangible, positive results
            - They are more efficient, using less time and money for similar or better results
            - Create positive energy for the participants as they feel impactful, respected and valued
            - They reinforce a sense of contributing to something larger than oneself
    -
        header: How to Have Effective Meetings
        bullets:
            - 0. Set Goals
            - 1. Plan the Meeting
            - 2. Inform
            - 3. Prepare
            - 4. Structure and Control
            - 5. Summarize and Record
    -
        header: "Plan: Get Clear on the Goal(s): Why"
        bullets:
            - A meeting with no goal is just a discussion.  At a formal meeting, discussion is a means, not an end in itself.
            - Think through what it is really needs to be accomplished and what *you* are really trying to accomplish
            - Perhaps you mean "To Inform", "To Understand", or "To Align", "To Decide", "To Learn" rather than "To Discuss"
            - Maybe you don't even need to have a meeting.  Will a simple email suffice?  Perhaps just an impromptu visit or two?
            - Even small meetings, especially standing/regular ones, are fairly heavy-weight; think about whether you can achieve the goal in a better/faster/cheaper way.
    -
        header: Well-crafted meeting goals
        bullets:
            - Specific, clear and concise
            - Relevant and meaningful to attendees
            - Assessable at meeting's end
            - Achievable
    -
        header: "Plan: Get Clear on the Agenda: What"
        bullets:
            - An agenda is not a substitute for a goal(s)
            - An agenda is the content the team needs to cover in order to reach the goal(s)
            - Use a logical sequence for the goal(s), attendees, time frame
            - Agenda topics *might need to be time-boxed* to ensure the overall goal(s) is met
            - Allocate time based on importance, not urgency
            - Ensure there is enough time to accomplish the goals with the attendees
    -
        header: " Plan: Have Just the Right People"
        bullets:
            - Invite all the people, and *only* those people, actually required to meet the goal
            - Limit the number of people to the essentials.  We all have a need to be understood, so the time necessary to conduct any amount of business effectively goes up with every additional person.
            - If any of the required people cannot make it, seriously consider postponing it.  But, perhaps they are NOT so required...
    -
        header: "Plan: Do Not Have A Meeting If You Should Not or Do Not Need One"
        bullets:
            - Some meetings, especially with a goal of "to inform" might be better as a simple email, or a few informal discussions
            - Any time the information flow is essentially one direction, that is a good candidate for an email (unless there are likely to be emotional reactions to the information)
    -
        header: "Inform Effectively: Communicate Concisely, Thoroughly"
        bullets:
            - Make sure all the attendees, plus any other critical stakeholders, know the goals and the agenda
            - Anticipate needs and issues and provide or mitigate
            - Identify clearly what prerequisites attendees should accomplish and/or what they need to bring with them
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Facilitate Effectively in the Moment"
        bullets:
            - Get there early enough to get set up and ensure everything you need is there and working
            - Start on time, or just a *little* fashionably late, once a quorum is present
            - Keep time and stick the agenda
            - Normally, whoever called a meeting facilitates it, but often that is not true, nor necessary
            - Facilitators participate as well more often than not, but if the meeting is large enough, that may be difficult.  A different facilitator may be utilized by the meeting sponsor so she can more fully participate without distraction or domination
            - What do you do when no quorum arrives on time?
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Establish and Stick to Ground Rules"
        subheader: "Identify the importance of and encourage:"
        bullets:

            - Safety
            - Respect
            - Participation
            - Focus
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Establish and Stick to Ground Rules"
        subheader: "As necessary, establish ground rules for the meeting e.g.:"
        bullets:
            - Use of screens
            - Letting people finish
            - Respect time-boxing
            - Parking lot tangents
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Somebody Probably Has to Scribe"
        bullets:
            - Most meetings, even many short stand-ups, need someone to write down any decisions, action items, etc.
            - The facilitator should be responsible for doing it, or assigning somebody else to do it
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Make Sure Everyone Knows Each Other"
        subheader: "Trust is the critical glue of the universe, and you cannot really trust someone you do not know"
        bullets:
            - For normal meetings, between 3 and 20 people, everyone should know each other's first name and enough about their role to understand why they are at the meeting
            - The more divergent the opinions, background, and knowledge of the topic areas of the participants, the more important this is
            - Larger meetings are more likely Presentations which is a different topic
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Choose a Structure"
        subheader: Standing meetings often already have well-defined goals, topics areas AND structure.  When decisions need to be made, use a sequence resembling
        bullets:

            - Bring in the non-combatants
            - Stick to facts
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Important Concentrations"
        subheader: Focus
        bullets:
            - Stay alert and watch out for irrelevant contributions
            - Keep a hand on the wheel
            - Test comprehension
            - Paraphrase and check back
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Important Concentrations"
        subheader: Mobilize
        bullets:

            - Analytical
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Consider the Participants Learning Styles"
        bullets:
            - Visual/spatial
            - Aural/auditory
            - Verbal/linguistic
            - Physical/kinesthetic
            - Logical/Mathematical
            - Social/interpersonal
            - Solitary/intra-personal
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Manage Group and Individual Dynamics"
        bullets:
            - Ensure participants have a chance to, are encouraged to, get their thoughts heard by the whole group
            - Ensure individuals do not over-dominate the discussion time
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Be Focused First, Flexible Second"
        subheader: "Focus on achieving the goal(s), but:"
        bullets:
            - Sometimes the attendees realize there is a better goal, or that the goal cannot yet be achieved without other prerequisites being met
            - Be open to the group figuring out it needs to change course
            - Avoid retracing old ground

            - Root cause analysis techniques
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Use a Parking Lot for Significant Tangents"
        text: >
            Often people identify topics/issues they want to discuss but that are outside the scope established by the goals of the meeting.
            A visible Parking Lot can be used to record topics that were identified but will not be covered in the meeting.
            Whiteboards or a paper easel are good for these items.
            Any Parking Lot items should be dispositioned at the end of, or after, the meeting for follow-up.
    -
        header: "Summarize and Record: Articulate the Outcomes"
        subheader: "Before time runs out on a meeting, articulate the results you understood"

            - Outcomes
            - Decisions
            - Action Items with assignments
            - Include plans, or not, to handle Parking Lot items
            - If there is any doubt about whether the goals were met, that should also be established
    -
        header: "Summarize and Record: Follow-Up in Writing"
        text : >
            Any significant outcomes, as well as useful notes, of the meeting should be emailed to all participants and any stakeholders in  those outcomes as soon as possible after the meeting
    -
        header: "Standing Meetings Are Easier, But No Different"
        text: >
            Frequently the goal(s) and agenda of standing meetings are already clearly defined and understood by the participants.
            If so, there is no need to reiterate those every time.
    -

        bullets:
            - Everyone has a need to feel understood
            - Few people like unpleasant surprises, especially in group situations
            - Some people are uncomfortable speaking in group situations
            - Some participants may feel confused, inadequate, insecure, superior, etc.
            - Everyone brings preconceptions about the goals, topics, and participants that unconsciously inhibit open-ness to other points of view
            - Everyone brings their own predisposition to be positive or negative about *change*, which is what meetings are often about
    -

        header: Facilitating Sprint Planning
        textClass: white
        thread: start
        bullets: 
            - Set and align on Sprint goal(s)
            - Figure out what can get done
            - Figure out how the selected work can get done
    -
        header: Facilitating Daily Standups
        textClass: white
        bullets:
            - Standup proper should be <= 15 minutes, focusing on the plans for the day
            - Problem-solving and other activities should be left to *after* standup proper (but should be done ASAP)
            - Standups are for the *team*.  Stakeholder are welcome, often invited, but should speak when asked questions
            - Healthy teams surface substantial issues in open settings
            - Avoid the obvious, the mechanical, the repetitive, the boring
            - Often the most important parts are the conversations that happen just *after* standup
            - Try to have everyone on level ground
            - Virtually all standup conversation should be clearly focused on a specific backlog item that everyone there knows.  Chickens that don't know can ask questions aftwerwards
            - Stay focused on exactly what you did yesterday (and this morning), what you *plan* on doing, *specifically*, today and tomorrow morning, and what if *anything* you might need from anyone else.  This includes not just what *area* you might be working in, but the actual hands-on thread-of-effort you are working *on*, and what *outcome* you are striving for today
            - It is NOT a status report.  No task ETAs, no percentage complete, etc.
            - Tie comments back to the Sprint Backlog Item, not just a task. A task is a *personal* framing of the sprint plan; the *backlog item* is the *shared* framing of the sprint plan

            - The development team says what went well, what didn't, what was discovered, how things were solved, etc.
