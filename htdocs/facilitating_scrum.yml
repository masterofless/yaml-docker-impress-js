title: Facilitating Scrum Meetings
tldr: Doing Scrum rightly requires knowing exactly what it is, how to effectively facilitate meetings, and how to handle all the missing pieces.  And like writing or prentation, facilitation is a core consulting craft skill and should be fiercely goal-driven.

        header: Goals for This Presentation
        bullets:
            - To help us deliver better solutions to clients, and optimize their experience as we do it
            - Explain how to more effectively facilitate Scrum ceremonies
            - Explain how to use Scrum when the client really isn't
        notes:
            - Theme 1: Communications is key to managing expectations and therefore to happiness
            - Theme 2: Planning can and should be very lightweight, but is nonetheless essential to software development

        header: Agenda
        bullets:
            - Scrum Refresher
            - Meeting Facilitation Basics
            - The intersection: facilitating Scrum, its ceremonies, and its cadence
    -
        header: Scrum Is Just One (very popular) Agile Methodology
        thread: start
        bullets:
            - Creating working software of reliable quality with every sprint
            - A consistent "Definition of Done" that the product must maintain, and every that increment must meet
            - 5 levels of planning
            - Sprinting with 5 ceremonies
            - 3 Roles
            - 3 Primary Artifacts and 4 Secondary Artifacts
    -
        header: Scrum Includes 3 Team Roles
        bullets:
            - Scrum Master
            - Product Owner
            - Development Team Member
        notes:
            - Everybody else that matters is a stakeholder or an SME/provider to the team
    -
        header: Scrum Includes 3 Primary Artifacts
        bullets:
            - Product Backlog
            - Sprint Backlog
            - Product Increment
    -
        header: Scrum Includes 4 Secondary Artifacts
        bullets:
            - Product Vision
            - Product Roadmap
            - Release Plan
            - Burnup/burndown charts for the product and sprints
    -
        header: Scrum Includes 1 Shared Definition of Done
        bullets:
            - Working builds and tests
            - Quality metrics including code complexity, test coverage, latency, etc.
            - Demonstrable results
    -
        header: Scrum Includes 5 Levels of Planning
        bullets:
            - Product Visioning
            - Product Road Mapping
            - Release Planning
            - Sprint Planning
            - Daily Planning
        notes:
            - Long-range plans are optimally fully fleshed and manifest in a product backlog before Sprint 0 but hey
            - The 3 types of longer range planning are done in secondary meetings, too often skipped
    -
        header: Scrum Includes 5 Ceremonies
        bullets:
            - *Backlog Grooming*
            - Sprint Planning
            - Daily Standup
            - Sprint Review
            - Retrospective
        note:
            - Backlog grooming is often omitted which is a fundamental cause of lost time and money
            - Backlog grooming can and should happen frequently, though *unnecessary* churn can cause big problems

        header: Why Effective Meeting Facilitation Is Important Period
        subheader: Before We Dive In
        text: >
            Many of you might not facilitate meetings often, others may already know all of this stuff and do it very well.  Even if so, I bet you'd admit that you *could* do it better more often than not.  I know I do.
            Hopefully there will be a nugget or two in here that resonates for you.
            Also, think of this as a superset of things to do for all meetings; no meeting uses all techniques.
    -
        header: Why Effective Meeting Facilitation Is Important for Scrum
        bullets:
            - Software development is uniquely complicated
            - The core problem is getting so many people aligned on so many details
            - Scrum meetings are the primary, the only required mechanism, because effective face-to-face communication is orders of magnitude better than any other way
            - Accomplishing significant improvements in just 2 weeks requires relentless focus on outcomes that many stakeholders need to understand from a wide variety of perspectives
    -
        header: Well-managed meetings are effective, they feel good, and they are a lot more fun
        bullets:
            - They are far more likely to achieve immediate, tangible, positive results
            - They are more efficient, using less time and money for similar or better results
            - Create positive energy for the participants as they feel impactful, respected and valued
            - They reinforce a sense of contributing to something larger than oneself
    -
        header: Poorly-managed meetings *suck* for everyone involved
        bullets:
            - Including non-present stakeholders, after all, our time is their money
            - They waste time, accomplishing little or no actual business value
            - They drain people's energy and create frustration
            - They *deter* real participation in the desired outcomes, for present and future meetings
    -
        header: How to Have Effective Meetings
        bullets:
            - 0. Set Goals
            - 1. Plan the Meeting
            - 2. Inform
            - 3. Prepare
            - 4. Structure and Control
            - 5. Summarize and Record
        notes:
            - Listen for and write down one or two things you can focus on trying to remember and improve for your own meetings
    -
        header: "Plan: Get Clear on the Meeting Goal(s)"
        bullets:
            - A meeting with no goal is just a discussion.  At a formal meeting, discussion is a means, not an end in itself.
            - Think through what it is really needs to be accomplished and what *you* are really trying to accomplish
            - Perhaps you mean "To Inform", "To Understand", or "To Align", "To Decide", "To Learn" rather than "To Discuss"
            - Maybe you don't even need to have a meeting.  Will a simple email suffice?  Perhaps just an impromptu visit or two?
            - Even small meetings, especially standing/regular ones, are fairly heavy-weight; think about whether you can achieve the goal in a better/faster/cheaper way.
            - "It is *always* good to start the formal meeting by reiterating and reconfirming the meeting goals with the audience: you are here for a *reason* beyond 'To discuss'"
        notes:
            - Don't just write them down, refer to and use them often as you plan and execute the meeting
            - Beware the inertia of standing meetings without clear goals and outcomes
            - Any time a goal starts with "To discuss", then somebody is being lazy or cagey; drive to clarity on tangible outcomes
    -
        header: Well-crafted meeting goals Are...
        bullets:
            - Specific, clear and concise
            - Relevant and meaningful to attendees
            - Achievable
            - Assessable at meeting's end
        notes:
            - Did we achieve our goals here today, why or why not, is always a fair question
    -
        header: "Plan: Get Clear on the Agenda"
        bullets:
            - An agenda is not a substitute for a goal(s)
            - An agenda is the content, sequence and timing the team needs to cover in order to reach the meeting goal(s)
            - Use a logical sequence for the goal(s), attendees, time frame
            - Agenda topics *might need to be time-boxed* to ensure the overall goal(s) is met
            - Allocate time based on importance, not urgency
            - Ensure there is enough time to accomplish the goals with the attendees
    -
        header: " Plan: Have Just the Right People"
        bullets:
            - Invite all the people, and *only* those people, actually required to meet the goal
            - Limit the invitees to the essentials
            - If any of the required people cannot make it, seriously consider postponing it.  But, perhaps they are NOT so required...
            - Not all meetings should include chickens (stakeholders as opposed to participants)
        notes:
            - We all have a need to be understood, so the time necessary to conduct any amount of business effectively goes up with every additional person
    -
        header: "Plan: Do Not Have A Meeting If You Should Not or Do Not Need One"
        bullets:
            - Some meetings, especially with a goal of "to inform" might be better as a simple email, or a few informal discussions
            - Any time the information flow is essentially one direction, that is a good candidate for an email (unless there are likely to be emotional reactions to the information)
    -
        header: "Inform Effectively: Communicate Concisely, Thoroughly"
        bullets:
            - Make sure all the attendees, plus any other critical stakeholders, know the goals and the agenda
            - Anticipate needs and issues and provide or mitigate
            - Identify clearly what prerequisites attendees should accomplish and/or what they need to bring with them
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Facilitate Effectively in the Moment"
        bullets:
            - Get there early enough to get set up and ensure everything you need is there and working
            - Start on time, or just a *little* fashionably late, once a quorum is present
            - Keep time and stick the agenda
            - Normally, whoever called a meeting facilitates it, but often that is not true, nor necessary
            - Facilitators also participate more often than not, but if the meeting is large enough, that will be difficult
            - A different facilitator may be utilized by the meeting sponsor so she can more fully participate without distraction or domination
        notes:
            - What do you do when no quorum arrives on time?
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Establish and Stick to Ground Rules"
        subheader: "As necessary, identify the importance of and adherence to ground rules for the meeting"
        bullets:
            - Open-ness
            - Safety
            - Respect
            - Letting people finish
            - Participation
            - Focus
            - Parking lot tangents
            - Use of screens
            - Respect time-boxing
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Somebody Probably Has to Scribe"
        bullets:
            - Most meetings, even many short stand-ups, need someone to write down any decisions, action items, etc.
            - The facilitator should be responsible for doing it, or assigning somebody else to do it
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Make Sure Everyone Knows Each Other"
        subheader: "Trust is the critical glue of the universe, and you cannot really trust someone you do not know"
        bullets:
            - For normal meetings, between 3 and 20 people, everyone should know each other's first name and enough about their role to understand why they are at the meeting
            - The more divergent the opinions, background, and knowledge of the topic areas of the participants, the more important this is
            - Larger meetings are more likely Presentations which is a different topic
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Choose a Structure"
        subheader: Standing meetings often already have well-defined goals, topics areas AND structure.  When decisions need to be made, use a sequence resembling
        bullets:
            - 1. Evidence
            - 2. Interpretation
            - 3. Action
            - 'When problem-solving, consider frameworks such as "5 Whys"'
        notes:
            - Very important to keep everyone in the same topic and mode e.g. brainstorming, problem solving, informing, decision making
            - When one participant tries to go an unexpected direction or inappropriate length, use the goals and agenda to wrangle them back into the structure of the meeting.  The other participants will thank you.
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Important Concentrations"
        subheader: Unite
        bullets:
            - Let off the steam
            - Don't take sides
            - Bring in the non-combatants
            - Stick to facts
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Important Concentrations"
        subheader: Focus
        bullets:
            - Stay alert and watch out for irrelevant contributions
            - Keep a hand on the wheel
            - Test comprehension
            - Paraphrase and check back
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Important Concentrations"
        subheader: Mobilize
        bullets:
            - Protect the weak and keep the strong under control
            - Check around the group and collect all contributions
            - Record all suggestions to avoid losing good points
            - Build up ideas, don't know them down
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Consider the Participants Social Styles"
        bullets:
            - Driver/Dominant
            - Social
            - Expressive/Amiable
            - Analytical
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Consider the Participants Learning Styles"
        bullets:
            - Visual/spatial
            - Aural/auditory
            - Verbal/linguistic
            - Physical/kinesthetic
            - Logical/Mathematical
            - Social/interpersonal
            - Solitary/intra-personal
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Manage Group and Individual Dynamics"
        bullets:
            - Ensure participants have a chance to, are encouraged to, get their thoughts heard by the whole group
            - Ensure individuals do not over-dominate the discussion time
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Be Focused First, Flexible Second"
        subheader: "Focus on achieving the goal(s), but:"
        bullets:
            - Sometimes the attendees realize there is a better goal, or that the goal cannot yet be achieved without other prerequisites being met
            - Be open to the group figuring out it needs to change course
            - Avoid retracing old ground
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Be Creative"
        subheader: "Try and find ways to create fun and engagement.  Consider using alternatives to a standard discussion format such as:"
        bullets:
            - Role playing
            - Brainstorming
            - Mind mapping
            - Scenario building
            - Round robin
            - Root cause analysis techniques
    -
        header: "Structure and Control: Use a Parking Lot for Significant Tangents"
        text: >
            Often people identify topics/issues they want to discuss but that are outside the scope established by the goals of the meeting.
            A visible Parking Lot can be used to record topics that were identified but will not be covered in the meeting.
            Whiteboards or a paper easel are good for these items.
            Any Parking Lot items should be dispositioned at the end of, or after, the meeting for follow-up.
    -
        header: "Summarize and Record: Articulate the Outcomes"
        subheader: "Before time runs out on a meeting, articulate the results you understood"
        bullets:
            - Outcomes
            - Decisions
            - Action Items with assignments
            - Include plans, or not, to handle Parking Lot items
            - If there is any doubt about whether the goals were met, that should also be established
    -
        header: "Summarize and Record: Follow-Up in Writing"
        text : >
            Any significant outcomes, as well as useful notes, of the meeting should be emailed to all participants and any stakeholders in  those outcomes as soon as possible after the meeting
    -
        header: "Standing Meetings Are Easier, But No Different"
        text: >
            Frequently the goal(s) and agenda of standing meetings are already clearly defined and understood by the participants.
            If so, there is no need to reiterate those every time.
    -
        header: "Some Important Psychological Truths to Keep In Mind"
        bullets:
            - Everyone has a need to feel understood
            - Few people like unpleasant surprises, especially in group situations
            - Some people are uncomfortable speaking in group situations
            - Some participants may feel confused, inadequate, insecure, superior, etc.
            - Everyone brings preconceptions about the goals, topics, and participants that unconsciously inhibit open-ness to other points of view
            - Everyone brings their own predisposition to be positive or negative about *change*, which is what meetings are often about
            - Talking and writing things down *during* the meeting is often far more effective at creating alignment than one person doing so and emailing it to everybody
        notes:
            - Again, be goal-driven
    -
        header: "Restating"
        bullets:
            - 1. Plan, starting with clear, achievable goals
            - 2. Inform the attendees and stakeholders
            - 3. Prepare
            - 4. Structure and Control, everybody likes fun
            - 5. Summarize and Record, make sure it sticks
    -
        thread: start
        header: Facilitating the Scrum Ceremonies
        bullets:
            - Reinforce the goals of each meeting
            - Relentlessly focus on adding features to working software, not how "done" we are
            - Remove any all barriers as quickly as possible, hopefully during the meeting
            - At first, write things down and follow up with an email summary to all participants
    -
        header: Facilitating Sprint Planning
        bullets:
            - Set and align on Sprint goal(s)
            - Figure out what can get done
            - Figure out how the selected work can get done
            - Attendees might need to include stakeholders depending on the backlog
            - Sprint backlog items with Acceptance Criteria are the usual goals
            - Relentlessly focus on decomposing things into clear and concise statements about software features
            - Create, adjust and/or confirm the *Definition of Done* as necessary
        notes:
            - You CAN start this meeting without a product backlog but you should end up with one
            - Grooming with scribing the sprint and product backlogs is *essential*
    -
        header: Facilitating Daily Standups
        bullets:
            - Standup proper should be <= 15 minutes, focusing on the plans for the day
            - Problem-solving and other activities should be left to *after* standup proper (but should be done ASAP)
            - Standups are for the *team*.  Stakeholder are welcome, often invited, but should speak when asked questions
            - Healthy teams surface substantial issues in open settings
            - Avoid the obvious, the mechanical, the repetitive, the boring
            - Often the most important parts are the conversations that happen just *after* standup
            - Try to have everyone on level ground
            - Virtually all standup conversation should be clearly focused on a specific backlog item that everyone there knows.  Chickens that don't know can ask questions aftwerwards
            - Stay focused on exactly what you did yesterday (and this morning), what you *plan* on doing, *specifically*, today and tomorrow morning, and what if *anything* you might need from anyone else.  This includes not just what *area* you might be working in, but the actual hands-on thread-of-effort you are working *on*, and what *outcome* you are striving for today
            - It is NOT a status report.  No task ETAs, no percentage complete, etc.
            - Tie comments back to the Sprint Backlog Item, not just a task. A task is a *personal* framing of the sprint plan; the *backlog item* is the *shared* framing of the sprint plan
    -
        header: Facilitating Sprint Reviews
        bullets:
            - Stakeholders invited by the Product Owner; all stakeholders should be considered
            - Product Owner demonstrates the product increment for review by all the attending Stakeholders
            - The development team says what went well, what didn't, what was discovered, how things were solved, etc.
            - The timeline, budget, context, and opportunities are reviewed and expectations are discussed and adjusted
            - The backlog is reviewed and may be groomed as the group collaborates on what should be done next
            - "The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been Done and what has not been Done"
    -
        header: Sprint Review Agenda
        bullets:
            - Product Owner (or the development team): demonstrates the product increment
            - Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been Done and what has not been Done
            - Development team describes the Sprint: what went well, what didn't, what was discovered, how things were solved, etc.
            - The timeline, budget, context, and opportunities are reviewed and expectations are discussed and adjusted
            - The Prioritized Backlog is reviewed and may be groomed as the larger group collaborates on what should be done next
    -
        header: Facilitating Retrospectives
        bullets:
            - Examine the sprint with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools
            - Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements
            - Go over the action items from the last retrospective and assess their status, impact, etc.
            - Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work
            - Try and find at least one thing the team can try to do differently during the next sprint in order to get better
            - Look for messages to take back to the Product Owner and Executive Sponsors around removing impediments
    -
        header: RAQs (Recently Asked Questions)
        thread: start
        bullets:
            - How can you get started when you still have data quality issues?
            - What if the client has no plan?
